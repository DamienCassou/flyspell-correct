* next-version

- Add highlighting of the word being currently corrected ([[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/52][#52]], thanks to
  [[https://github.com/hubisan][@hubisan]]).
- Support Emacs customization interface - =customize=.
- Fix non-breaking rapid mode with helm interface (see [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/60][#60]]).
- Fix exception when trying to remove missing =flyspell-correct-overlay=
  (happens when buffer has no words to correct).
- Fix exception when dealing with missing marks.
- Fix word at point not being prioritised by =flyspell-correct-move=,
  =flyspell-correct-next=, =flyspell-correct-previous= and
  =flyspell-correct-wrapper= by explicitly sort overlays so misspelled word at
  point is always at the beginning of the list.
- Align point movement between =flyspell-correct-at= and
  =flyspell-correct-move=, so there is no difference in resulting point location
  when any of these functions is called with point at misspelled word.
- Rewrite all tests using [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup][buttercup]] library.
- Allow to correct and save the word in one pass (see [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/66][#66]], [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/68][#68]]).
- New action - =stop= allowing to leave the point at the misspelled word.
- =skip= action now allows to correct 'next' word even if rapid mode is not
  enabled ([[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/58][#58]]).
- Allow to hook into =flyspell-correct-ivy= interface via
  =flyspell-correct-ivy-map= (fixes [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/58][#58]], see example in [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/issues/72][#72]]).
- Add actions to =flyspell-correct-dummy= interface (see [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct/pull/78][#78]]).

- Create a wrapper function for most of the cases, namely
  =flyspell-correct-wrapper=.
- Implement a 'rapid mode' for =flyspell-correct-wrapper=, allowing user to fix
  multiple words in one run (=skip= action can be used to skip current incorrect
  word and continue to the next one).
- Add some simple tests to cover the most important use cases.
